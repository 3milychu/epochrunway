# Epoch Runway

Epoch Runway is a web desktop application created in Parsons MSDV Major Studio in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, NY.

Advisors:<br>
Instructor, Parsons: Richard The<br>
General Manager of Collection Information, MET: Jennie Choi<br>

## Summary

The build uses R, opencv, d3.js and jquery to reclass parts of the body that objects in the MET's Costume Institute belong, and create generative art pieces informed by that positioning. The result is three interactive data art scenes.
